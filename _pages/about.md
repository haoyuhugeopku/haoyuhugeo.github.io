I am a research associate at Department of Geography and Resource Management, [the Chinese University of Hong Kong](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/chinese/). I obtained my PhD degree from [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/) in September 2023, under the supervision of Prof. Pengjun Zhao. My research interests include big data geocomputation, transport geography and sustainable regional development.
